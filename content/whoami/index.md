Hey everyone! I'm Denny Abraham Sinagal, a recent frash graduate from Del Institute of Technology.
During my university journey, I had opportunity to work as a Penetration Tester during my internship, delving into the world of cybersecurity.

I've recently kicked off my Capture The Flag (CTF) adventures in 2023, participating in both international and local events. 
This year, I achieved a milestone by obtaining a CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker) practical certification, solidifying my commitment to the cybersecurity field.

As I set my sights on the upcoming year, I'm gearing up for new adventures and opportunities in the vast world of cybersecurity. 
If only chances were as abundant as cat videos on the internet! In an ideal scenario, I'd be expanding my knowledge, leveling up my skills, and maybe even stumbling upon a career-defining moment.

In the unpredictable journey ahead, I'll be navigating through the twists and turns, hoping to uncover hidden gems that enhance my cybersecurity prowess. Whether it's a breakthrough project, a deeper understanding of the digital landscape, or a career milestone, I'm ready for the ride.

If you're curious about the twists and turns of my cyber journey and the lessons learned along the way, dive into my blog at [dennysinaga.com](https://www.dennysinaga.com/blog/).
It's a digital diary of my cybersecurity odyssey, filled with insights, anecdotes, and who knows, maybe a few random thoughts from outside the cybersecurity realm.


Btw, for those interested in checking out my projects, you can find them on my GitHub page at [dennyabrahamsinaga](https://github.com/dennyabrahamsinaga). 
I'm always open to discussions about cybersecurity or anything tech-related. 
Let's connect and explore the digital landscape together!
