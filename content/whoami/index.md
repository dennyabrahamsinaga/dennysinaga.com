Hello everyone! I'm Denny Abraham Sinagal, a recent graduate from Del Institute of Technology. 
During university, I worked as a Penetration Tester, diving into cybersecurity. 
In 2023, I embarked on Capture The Flag (CTF) adventures, earning a CEH certification this year, solidifying my commitment to cybersecurity.

Looking ahead, I'm gearing up for new cybersecurity adventures. 
If only opportunities were as abundant as cat videos online! Ideally, I'd expand my knowledge, skills, and maybe stumble upon a career-defining moment.

In the unpredictable journey ahead, I'll navigate twists, hoping to uncover gems that enhance my cybersecurity prowess—a breakthrough project, a deeper digital understanding, or a career milestone.

I'm open to cybersecurity and tech discussions. 
Let's connect and explore the digital landscape together!
